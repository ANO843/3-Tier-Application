# 3-Tier-Application
This repository stores a Bash script for deploying a 3-tier architecture on AWS using the AWS CLI. The script will create a VPC with public and private subnets, an internet gateway and NAT gateway along with route tables. The script will create security groups for the frontend, backend and database to ensure restricted and secured access. The script will create an RDS MySQL instance in the private subnet, a backend EC2 instance running a Django application in another private subnet, and a frontend EC2 instance in a public subnet with NGINX already configured to proxy the requests to the backend. All hosted components are configured with appropriate tags, user-data scripts and access control to enable a basic, but functional 3-tier web application deployment.
